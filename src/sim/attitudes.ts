 * The original's two attitude channels, per person and gang: hostility and
 * fear, each a byte (0..255). The single remake `Person.opinion` scalar stays
 * for the systems that were written against it; the recovered election tally
 * and anything else ported from the original reads these channels instead.
 *
 * Initial values: `base + rand % range` from Constants.xtx per actor class
 * (OWNER_/CIVILIAN_/HOOD_/… HOSTILITY and FEAR, #12..#63). A person who has
 * never been written holds that roll, derived from a stable hash of the person
 * and gang so the remake's RNG sequence and old saves are unchanged. Owners
 * and civilians roll fear as base + roll + their hostility, so they start
 * close to neutral (h − f = −(fear base + roll)); the sum never goes negative.
 *
 * Shopkeepers in the original city also get the HQ-distance initialisation of
 * Gang_PlaceHeadquarters (0x6566A0): see `seedOriginalOwnerAttitudes`.
